      <p>
        I am a fresh graduate in Informatics from Telkom University with a
        strong interest in cybersecurity, networking, and machine learning. My
        academic and hands-on experiences have built a solid foundation in these
        areas, especially through my internship as a SOC analyst and involvement
        in various research and applied projects. I am currently seeking
        opportunities to grow my career or contribute to research in
        cybersecurity, machine learning, and related fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time as a student in mid-2024, I completed an internship at
        Telkomsigma, a subsidiary of Telkom Indonesia, where I was responsible
        for monitoring network traffic and handling cybersecurity tasks for
        multinational clients. I used tools like SIEM, QRadar, Cybereason,
        Stellar, and others to detect unusual activity and create reports that
        helped clients improve their security.

      <p>
        In late 2023, I had the honor of securing project funding of 13 million
        Rupiah (about $850) for an Internet of Things (IoT) project, ranking in
        the top 163 nationally in the Innovillage Competition. This project
        involved designing an automated irrigation system that utilized time,
        humidity, and temperature data to optimize water usage. Beyond IoT, I
        have significant experience in machine learning, deep learning, and
        artificial intelligence, with a strong foundation in data analysis, NLP,
        and computer vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also recently completed the Bangkit Academy program, led by Google,
        Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka. This immersive experience introduced me
        to advanced machine learning topics and practical model deployment. I
        led the development of an AI model for &apos;Sereluna&apos;, a mental
        health mobile app, using natural language processing to analyze user
        diary entries for mental health insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I have actively contributed to Telkom
        University&apos;s Informatics Laboratory as an assistant, teaching data
        structures and supporting practicum sessions for nearly 90 students.
        Additionally, my involvement in the Forensic and Security Laboratory has
        strengthened my knowledge in cybersecurity, where I honed my skills in
        Linux, network security, and web hacking through practical challenges
        like Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises.
